# Discord-Level-Bot
This bot is meant to level you up on Discord servers that use MEE6 or other leveling platforms.

It will send messages over and over again with a random delay (3.5-10mins) to avoid getting caught easily.

Basically what i'm trying to say is:
if you get banned for using a level bot... don't come crying to me. 

You're the one used a level bot lmao
